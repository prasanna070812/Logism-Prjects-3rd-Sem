# Digital Logic Circuits – Logisim Projects

This repository contains multiple Logisim circuit files created while learning and practicing **Digital Logic Design** fundamentals. Each project represents a core concept in combinational logic, Boolean algebra, and gate-level circuit implementation. The goal of this collection is to understand how digital systems work internally by designing, building, and testing circuits from basic gates to arithmetic units.

## 📘 What I Learned

Through these Logisim projects, I gained hands-on understanding of:

### ✔️ 1. Basic Logic Gates

* Designed AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR gates.
* Learned how each gate manipulates binary inputs.
* Understood truth tables, logic symbols, and behavior representation.

### ✔️ 2. Boolean Expressions & Simplification

* Implemented Boolean expressions using basic gates.
* Understood how complex expressions can be broken into primitives.
* Gained confidence in mapping algebraic expressions → circuit diagrams.

### ✔️ 3. Universal Gates (NAND / NOR)

* Built circuits using **only NAND gates** to show functional completeness.
* Learned that any logical circuit can be implemented using a single universal gate.

### ✔️ 4. Arithmetic Circuits

* Designed **Half Adder** and **Full Adder** circuits.
* Extended the concepts to **Subtractor** circuits.
* Understood binary addition, carry generation, and cascading logic.

### ✔️ 5. Modular Circuit Design

* Built reusable components in Logisim.
* Connected multiple subcircuits into a complete functional design.
* Practiced neat circuit structuring, labeling, and input-output organization.

These projects strengthened my understanding of **digital logic**, **binary arithmetic**, and **hardware-level computation**.
